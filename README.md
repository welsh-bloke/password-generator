# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview

This web app was created for the purpose of gaining experience writing advanced JavaScript. The application alows the user
to generate a random password based on the following criteria:

- [The number of characters required for the password]
- [If the user wants to include numeric characters]
- [If the user wants to include lower case characters]
- [If the user wants to include upper case characters]
- [If the user wants to include special characters]

The app also validates the user input by ensuring that:

- [The user enters a number between 10 and 64 inclusive]
- [The user choosed at least one character type]

The application uses the following prompts to guide the user through the process of generating a secure password:
